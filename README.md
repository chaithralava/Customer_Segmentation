# Customer_Segmentation
Description
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending scores. By grouping customers with similar behaviors, businesses can develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer experiences, and optimize product offerings. Using unsupervised machine learning, the project aims to identify patterns within customer data to support data-driven decision-making.
